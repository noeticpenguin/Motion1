<p>Salesforce1 is a revolutionary new interface for Salesforce that is not only gorgeous, but for many use cases it's faster! Unfortunately, Salesforce1 is understood by many to be a mobile only interface, available only on iOS and Android devices. Motion1 changes that. With Motion1, Mac users running OS X on their desktops and laptops, can securely log into their Salesforce orgs and utilize the Salesforce1 interface. </p>

<ul>
<li>Push Notifications <em>If your org has them enabled.</em>
</li>
<li>Org Admin controlled object and app settings</li>
<li>SF1 Enabled Apps like TaskRay</li>
<li>The Tasks and Dashboards apps</li>
<li>Publisher Actions </li>

<ul>
<li>Motion1 is multi-org by default. You can log into 1 or all of your orgs. Simply use the file menu and select the type of org you want to log into. At the moment, Production (which includes developer and my-Domain orgs), Sandbox and Pre-Release orgs are supported. </li>
<li>Native app integration for Mail. Use Mail.app to write emails? when you click on an email link in Motion1, the link is transparently handed off to your selected Mail client. </li>
</ul><h2>
<a name="sadly-somethings-dont-work-yet" class="anchor" href="#sadly-somethings-dont-work-yet"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Sadly, somethings don't work yet:</h2>

<ul>
<li>You can't make a call from within Motion1, at least until osX 10.10 Yosimite is released this fall.</li>
<li>You can't login to the Success Community (yet)</li>
</ul><h2>
<a name="how-does-it-work" class="anchor" href="#how-does-it-work"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How does it work?</h2>

<p>Motion1 utilizes RubyMotion to present X number of windows to the user, each with a predefined login url to either a production (login.salesforce.com) or sandbox (test.salesforce.com) and Salesforce presents their standard login form. Once your credentials are submitted to Salesforce (** At no time does Motion1 access, or store your credentials**) and you're successfully authenticated, the App directs you to /one/one.app the web formatted version of Salesforce1. Each window remains independent -- credentials are silo'd to the window presenting that org. </p>

<h2>
<a name="why" class="anchor" href="#why"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why?</h2>

<p>I hate Chatter desktop. Actually thats not true. I don't like flex / flash and the adobe bit that powers Chatter desktop has always poked my "can you do it better?" brain spot. Additionally, I wanted something that was multi-org. I didn't want to keep multipe browser's or multiple private browsing tabs open to stay in touch with the 5 orgs I'm regularly in. This is a step in the right direction at least. In additition to it's utility as a replacement for Chatter desktop, here are some other things you can do with it:</p>

<ul>
<li>It's a much more lightweight "simulator" when your developing a SF1 mobile app. </li>
<li>It's a great way to have multiple logins (as different roles / profiles) into the same org to see how objects and apps behave</li>
<li>It's resizable to emulate various Android screen sizes/resolutions</li>
</ul><h2>
<a name="how-can-i-help" class="anchor" href="#how-can-i-help"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How can I help?</h2>

<ul>
<li>File bug reports that tell me how to reproduce the issue regardless of the org I log into. If an issue is only reproduceable in your org ... hard to help. You can file issues here: [<a href="https://github.com/noeticpenguin/Motion1/issues">https://github.com/noeticpenguin/Motion1/issues</a>]</li>
<li>Come up with awesome ideas of what to do next. File an issue!</li>
<li>Edit the wiki!</li>
<li>Buy me a beer, or whatever.</li>
<li>Hey, I just met you, and I know this sounds crazy, But here's my GitTip [<a href="https://www.gittip.com/noeticpenguin/">https://www.gittip.com/noeticpenguin/</a>] so Tip me, maybe?</li>
